# Copilot Codebase Search Demonstration

This expanded project provides numerous examples to demonstrate GitHub Copilot's powerful codebase search capabilities. With multiple files and complex code patterns, this codebase is ideal for showcasing how Copilot can help navigate and understand large projects.

## Search Demonstration Examples

### 1. Finding Functions Across Files

Try searching for these functions that exist in different files:
- Search: `toTitleCase`
- Search: `validateSchema`
- Search: `requireAuth`
- Search: `findUserById`
- Search: `markComplete task`

### 2. Finding Database Operations

Try searching for database patterns:
- Search: `update user in database`
- Search: `find all tasks`
- Search: `database initialization`
- Search: `save collection to file`

### 3. Finding API Endpoints and Routes

Try searching for API endpoints:
- Search: `POST /users endpoint`
- Search: `mark task as complete API`
- Search: `authentication endpoint`
- Search: `delete task endpoint`

### 4. Authentication and Authorization

Try searches related to auth:
- Search: `verify token`
- Search: `require admin role`
- Search: `login user function`
- Search: `token generation`

### 5. Model and Data Structure Implementations

Try searching for data models:
- Search: `User class implementation`
- Search: `task is overdue check`
- Search: `notification queue processing`
- Search: `metrics calculation`

### 6. Testing Code

Try searching for test-related code:
- Search: `test for email validation`
- Search: `memoize function test`
- Search: `title case test cases`

### 7. Utility Functions

Try searching for utility functions:
- Search: `group array by property`
- Search: `calculate percentile`
- Search: `email validation regex`
- Search: `promise delay function`

### 8. Real-World Patterns

Try searching for common implementation patterns:
- Search: `notification service`
- Search: `error handling`
- Search: `sort tasks by due date`
- Search: `process queue asynchronously`
- Search: `metrics tracking`

## Copilot Search Demonstration Tips

1. **Show Natural Language Understanding**: Try "how do we validate user input?" versus "validation schema"

2. **Show Cross-File Functionality**: Try "how do tasks get created?" to see how Copilot connects routes, models, and database code

3. **Show Implementation Discovery**: Try "how is caching implemented?" to find the memoization function

4. **Progressive Search Refinement**: Start with "user authentication" and refine to "token verification"

5. **Compare File Navigation Approaches**: Show the difference between manual navigation and Copilot search when looking for specific functionality

6. **Functional Understanding**: Ask "where do we handle overdue tasks?" to show how Copilot understands code purpose, not just keywords
